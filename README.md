Chris Kroenke's blog. 

Built with fastHTML and MonsterUI. Posts are created and rendered as Jupyter notebooks.

It borrows heavily from the execnb library from Answer.ai. It is an alternative to Quarto notebook publishing, meant to explore and become more familiar with FastHTML and MonsterUI.

## Acknowledgements

This is based heavily on the work by Dr. Chris Levy who set up a blog with fastHTML and notebook rendering.
