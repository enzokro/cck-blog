    "The way humans speak is famously unpredictable and non-linear. We don't continuously draw from our entire voacbulary at every moment. And we don't hold the total, fixed set of words said so far in our working memory (we could only hold 7 +/- 2 of them at a time, anyway). We deal with the evolving gestalt of the conversation, its concepts, and the relationships between them. Crucially, we actively work in feedback about our words and the impact they're having.  \n",

Most people have a rough handle on how far away a mile is, or on how far apart two cities in their own country are. But there is no good, grounded mental model for how far away Pluto is, let alone our closest neighboring galaxy. Put frankly, our brains did not evolve and are simply not built to understand what an enormous distance that cosmic gap truly *is*, or what it would feel like to travel it. When we say that LLMs are \"just predicting the next word,\" it's like saying we could \"just\" reasonably travel to Andromeda. "

All they see are incredibly long sequences of tokens, are able to attend and process over their relationships thanks for their attention mechanisms. From these sequences they distill patterns. They're able to learn (or at least know) what sequences make sense in the landscape of all possible combinations of letters and punctuation.\n",

Pre-training effectively show the models the slice(s) of this space that cover actual, informative human communication. \n",

    "Every single week, models are getting better. And every few months, they unlock new capabilities that seemed previously unthinkable to many NLP researchers. Critics are forced to move the goalposts, and one gets the impression that they're playing a losing game. \"I'm not owned! I'm not owned!\" they scream into the night. \n",

    "Thinking of post-training in this way gives us direct evidence of why LLMs have become so powerful. Any problem space where solutions can be faithfully represented and arrived to as linear, causal sequences of information can in theory be solved by post-training LLMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear, causal sequences are an enormous subspace of the actions human beings take in the world. These are the actions our brains and bodies have been tuned for over millenia. However, they are far from the complete picture. Our most challenging and interesting problems are often non-linear and hierarchical.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to accurately represent them as a linear flow in token space in any resonable amount of time or space.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle these problems, LLMs would need their post-training to incorporate feedback loops, and to operate intermittently at different levels of abstraction (this is part of why YAML tags became such powerful aids for complex tasks). There are active areas of research to make this possible. But it is a young approach and the waters are still murky. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we do currently have a way of bootstrapping and injecting this non-linear, hierarchical processing into LLMs: Agents. I believe this is why Agents have so much hype around them. People can almost feel, if not quite put into words, that *this* is what we need for LLMs to reach the next level.  "

    "I explored this a bit more in [my post about Agents](https://enzokro.dev/blog/blog_post?fpath=blog%2F009_llm_agents%2Fllm_agents.ipynb). To summarize the takeaway: Agents give LLMs a way to break away from the linear, discrete turn-based interactions. By retrieving external context, they cbreak the isolated linearity of a conversation. And by calling external tools (possibly even other LLMs), they both break linearity and dip into different levels of abstraction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main power of Agents as of writing. They give us a way of directly improving the dynamics of the trajectories that models travel in their token space. The correct conclusion is not to look at Agents as salvation in and of themsleves, but to realize that the weaving in non-linearity and hierarchy is crucial to solving our most complex, interesting problems. Agents simply happen to be the most direct, accessible way of doing that. At least for now. "
