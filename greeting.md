Welcome! My name is Chris Kroenke. I'm a Research Engineer with 9 years of experience in vision, NLP, and speech. 

This site is my scratchpad for notes and ideas. Comments are open, I'd love to hear your feedback and thoughts! 

I also enjoy baking, archery, and translating novels from Spanish to English.
