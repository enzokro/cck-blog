Welcome! My name is Chris Kroenke. I'm a Research Engineer with 9 years of experience in a variety of ML domains like vision, NLP, and speech. My focus is on building efficient, real-time systems that work in novel and challenging environments. 

This site is a scratchpad for technical (and regular) thoughts I'm having. Comments are open, I'd love to hear your feedback and ideas! 

On the side I enjoy baking, archery, and translating novels from Spanish to English.
